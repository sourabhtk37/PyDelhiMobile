**How to add a screen**

Step 1: Create a new file, add the following Template for a clean Screen

	'''Module XYZ:
	This is the documentation for the Module that explains the
	main usecase of this Module and details it's usage.
	'''

	from kivy.uix.screenmanager import Screen
	from kivy.lang import Builder

	class ScreenSponsor(Screen):
	    '''This is the documentation for the Screen that explains
	    the main usecase of this Screen and details it's usage.
	    '''

	    # Here we define the UI of this screen.
	    Builder.load_string('''
<ScreenSponsor>
	name: 'ScreenSponsor'
	# your Widgets here,  we just use 2 buttons in boxlayout as demo
	BoxLayout
	    Button
	    Button
	''')

Take special note of the names::

    The `name: ScreenSponsor`, in this same as the class name `class ScreenSponsor(...)`.


Step 2: Save the file as `screensponsor.py` in the folder `<PyDelhiConf/pydelhiconf/uix/screens>`. Take note to name the file same as the class name,  in our case `ScreenSponsor` in lowercase with .py appended at end.

That's it. Now to load this screen::

    Button:
    	on_release:
            app.load_screen('ScreenSponsor', manager=app.navigation_manager)

`manager=` is a optional parameter, which specifies which `ScreenManager` to load this screen in.
If it is omitted this screen will be loaded into the main Screen Manager Which is responsobile for loading `StartupScreen` and `NavigationScreen`.
